# SCOREBOARD

This is an application that helps track score of a certain game or event.

It's built with react.js, Html and CSS. I mostly created this application because I want to keep developing my react knowledge of class and function components, html rendering, working with pure component and more.

The app allow to add and remove players, increase and decrease scores with button clicks. It also have an stats section where the number of players and the total number of points are being tracked.
